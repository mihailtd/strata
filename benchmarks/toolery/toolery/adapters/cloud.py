"""Cloud-API adapter: same wire protocol as OpenAIRawAdapter but targets a
remote OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Together, Anthropic-via-
proxy, etc.) rather than a local vLLM/Ollama/llama.cpp server.

Difference from `raw` is operational, not protocol-level:
  - requires an API key (raw can run without one against open local servers)
  - emits `name = "cloud"` so the DB / rankings can distinguish cloud-hosted
    runs from local-server runs even when the same model name appears in both
